      "Company, slamming the drafting board with his hairy fist, \"I want\n",
      "results!\"\n",
      "\n",
      "Heads lifted over boards. Kalvin Feetch shrunk visibly.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"As chief engineer you're not carrying the ball,\" Piltdon went on\n",
      "savagely. \"The Piltdon Can-Opener is trailing the competition.\n",
      "Advertising and Sales are breaking their necks. It's Engineering\n",
      "that's missing the boat!\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"But Mr. Piltdon,\" remonstrated Feetch unsteadily under his employer's\n",
      "glare, \"don't you remember? I tried to....\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"For two years there hasn't been one lousy improvement in the Piltdon\n",
      "Can-Opener!\" roared Mr. Piltdon. \"Look at our competitors. The\n",
      "International rips apart cans in three and three-tenths seconds.\n",
      "Universal does it in four.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"But Mr. Piltdon--\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"The Minerva Mighty Midget does it in four point two two and plays Home\n",
      "Sweet Home in chimes. Our own Piltdon opener barely manages to open a\n",
      "can in eight point nine without chimes. Is this what I'm paying you\n",
      "for?\"\n",
      "\n",
      "Feetch adjusted his spectacles with shaking hands. \"But Mr. Piltdon,\n",
      "our opener still has stability, solidity. It is built to last. It has\n",
      "dignity....\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Dignity,\" pronounced Piltdon, \"is for museums. Four months, Feetch!\n",
      "In four months I want a new can-opener that will be faster, lighter,\n",
      "stronger, flashier and more musical than any other on the market. I\n",
      "want it completely developed, engineered and tooled-up, ready for\n",
      "production. Otherwise, Feetch--\"\n",
      "\n",
      "Feetch's body twitched. \"But Mr. Piltdon, four months is hardly time\n",
      "enough for development, even with an adequate staff. I've been trying\n",
      "to tell you for years that we're bound to fall behind because we don't\n",
      "have enough personnel to conduct research. Our men can barely keep\n",
      "up with production and maintenance. If you would let me put on a few\n",
      "draftsmen and....\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Excuses,\" sneered Mr. Piltdon. \"Your staff is more than adequate.\n",
      "I will not allow you to throw out my money. Four months, Feetch,\n",
      "no more!\" Piltdon trudged out of the room, leaving behind him an\n",
      "oppressive silence.\n",
      "\n",
      "How could you set a time limit on research and development? A designer\n",
      "had to dream at his board, investigate, search, build, test, compare,\n",
      "discard. He had always wanted to devote all his time to research, but\n",
      "Piltdon Opener had not given him that opportunity. Twenty-five years!\n",
      "thought Feetch. Twenty-five years of close supervision, dead-lines,\n",
      "production headaches, inadequate facilities and assistance. What had\n",
      "happened, to the proud dream he once had, the dream of exploring\n",
      "uncharted engineering regions, of unlimited time to investigate and\n",
      "develop?\n",
      "\n",
      "Ah, well, thought Feetch straightening his thin shoulders, he had\n",
      "managed somehow to design a few good things during his twenty-five\n",
      "years with Piltdon. That was some satisfaction.\n",
      "\n",
      "What now? He had to hang on to his job. Technical work was scarce.\n",
      "Since the early 1980's the schools had been turning out more\n",
      "technicians than industry could absorb. He was too old to compete in\n",
      "the employment market. He couldn't afford to lose any money. Jenny\n",
      "wasn't well.\n",
      "\n",
      "How to meet this four month dead-line? He would get right on it\n",
      "himself, of course; Hanson--good man--could work with him. He shook his\n",
      "head despairingly. Something would be sure to blow up. Well, he had to\n",
      "start--\n",
      "\n",
      "*       *       *       *       *\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Chief,\" said Hanson a few weeks later as they entered the lab, \"I'm\n",
      "beginning to wonder if the answer is in the hand mechanical type at\n",
      "all.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Got to be,\" answered Feetch tiredly. \"We must work along classical\n",
      "can-opener lines. Departures, such as the thermal or motor-driven\n",
      "types, would be too expensive for mass production.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "Three new models and a group of cans were waiting for them on the\n",
      "bench. They began testing, Hanson operating the openers and Feetch\n",
      "clocking. \"Four point four,\" announced Feetch after the last test.\n",
      "\"Good, but not good enough. Too bulky. Appearance unsatisfactory.\n",
      "Chimes tinny. We've made progress, but we've a long way to go.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "The problem was tricky. It might seem that use of the proper gear\n",
      "ratios would give the required velocity, but there were too many\n",
      "other factors that negated this direct approach. The mechanism had to\n",
      "be compact and streamlined. Gear sizes had to be kept down. Can-top\n",
      "resistance, internal resistance, cutting tooth performance, handle\n",
      "size and moment, the minimum strength of a woman's hand were some of\n",
      "the variables that had to be balanced within rigid limits. Sector\n",
      "type cutters, traversing several arcs at the same time, had seemed to\n",
      "offer the answer for a while, but the adjusting mechanism necessary to\n",
      "compensate for variable can sizes had been too complex to be practical.\n",
      "There was the ever-present limit to production cost.\n",
      "\n",
      "Hanson's eyes were upon him. \"Chief,\" he said, \"it's a rotten shame.\n",
      "Twenty-five years of your life you put in with Piltdon, and he'd fire\n",
      "you just like that if you don't do the impossible. The Piltdon Company\n",
      "is built upon your designs and you get handed this deal!\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Well, well,\" said Feetch. \"I drew my pay every week so I suppose I\n",
      "have no complaints. Although,\" a wistful note crept into his voice \"I\n",
      "would have liked a little recognition. Piltdon is a household word,\n",
      "but who has heard of Feetch? Well,\"--Feetch blew his nose--\"how do we\n",
      "stand, Hanson?\"\n",
      "\n",
      "Hanson's bull-dog features drew into a scowl. \"Piltdon ought to\n",
      "be rayed,\" he growled. \"O.K., Chief. Eleven experimental models\n",
      "designed to date. Two more on the boards. Nine completed and tested,\n",
      "two in work. Best performance, four point four, but model otherwise\n",
      "unsatisfactory.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Hello,\" said Feetch as an aproned machinist entered carrying a\n",
      "glistening mechanism. \"Here's another model. Let's try it.\" The\n",
      "machinist departed and Hanson locked the opener on a can. \"I hope----\"\n",
      "he turned the handle, and stopped abruptly, staring down open-mouthed.\n",
      "\n",
      "A cylinder of close-packed beans rested on the bench under the opener.\n",
      "\n",
      "The can itself had disappeared.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Chief,\" said Hanson. \"Chief.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Yes,\" said Feetch. \"I see it too. Try another can.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Vegetable soup or spinach?\" inquired Hanson dreamily.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Spinach, I think,\" said Feetch. \"Where did the can go, do you suppose?\"\n",
      "\n",
      "The spinach can disappeared. Likewise several corn cans, sweet potato\n",
      "cans and corned-beef hash cans, leaving their contents intact. It was\n",
      "rather disconcerting.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Dear, dear,\" said Feetch, regarding the piles of food on the bench.\n",
      "\"There must be some explanation. I designed this opener with sixteen\n",
      "degree, twenty-two minute pressure angle modified involute gear\n",
      "teeth, seven degree, nineteen minute front clearance cutter angle and\n",
      "thirty-six degree, twelve minute back rake angle. I expected that such\n",
      "departures from the norm might achieve unconventional performance, but\n",
      "this--Dear, dear. Where do the cans go, I wonder?\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"What's the difference? Don't you see what you've got here? It's the\n",
      "answer! It's more than the answer! We can put this right into work and\n",
      "beat the dead-line.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "Feetch shook his head. \"No, Hanson. We're producing something we don't\n",
      "understand. What forces have we uncovered here? Where do the cans go?\n",
      "What makes them disappear? Are we dealing with a kinetic or a kinematic\n",
      "effect? What motions can we plot in the area of disappearance and what\n",
      "are their analytical mathematical formulae? What masses may be critical\n",
      "here? What transformations of energy are involved? No, Hanson, we must\n",
      "learn a lot more.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"But Chief, your job.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"I'll risk that. Not a word to Piltdon.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "Several days later, however, Piltdon himself charged into the drawing\n",
      "room and slapped Feetch heartily on the back, causing him to break a\n",
      "pencil point. \"Feetch!\" roared Piltdon. \"Is this talk that's going\n",
      "around the plant true? Why didn't you tell me? Let's see it.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "After Piltdon had seen it his eyes took on a feverish glint. \"This,\"\n",
      "he exulted, \"will make can-opener history. Instantaneous opening!\n",
      "Automatic disposal! Wait until Advertising and Sales get hold of this!\n",
      "We'll throttle our competitors! The Piltdon Super-Opener we'll call it.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Mr. Piltdon--\" said Feetch shakily.\n",
      "\n",
      "Piltdon stared at his chief engineer sharply. \"What's the matter,\n",
      "Feetch? The thing can be duplicated, can't it?\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Yes, sir. I've just finished checking that. But I'm in the midst of\n",
      "further investigation of the effect. There's more here than just a new\n",
      "type can-opener, sir. A whole new field of physics. New principles.\n",
      "This is big, Mr. Piltdon. I recommend that we delay production until\n",
      "further research can be completed. Hire a few top scientists and\n",
      "engineers. Find out where the cans go. Put out a scientific paper on\n",
      "the effect.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Feetch,\" bit out Piltdon, his face growing hard. \"Stow this hooey. I\n",
      "don't give a damn where the cans go. May I remind you that under our\n",
      "standard patent agreement, all rights to your invention belong to the\n",
      "company? As well as anything you may produce in the field within a year\n",
      "after leaving our employ? We have a good thing here, and I don't want\n",
      "you holding it back. We're going into production immediately.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "*       *       *       *       *\n",
      "\n",
      "Close, thought Feetch, wearily. It had been a man-killing job, and it\n",
      "had been close, but he'd made it. Beat the time limit by a half-day.\n",
      "The first tentative shipments of Piltdon Super-Openers had gone to\n",
      "distributors along the Eastern seaboard. The first advertisements\n",
      "blazed in selected media. The first reorders came back, and then: \"It's\n",
      "a sell-out!\" crowed Piltdon, waving a sheaf of telegrams. \"Step up\n",
      "production! Let 'er rip!\"\n",
      "\n",
      "The Super-Openers rolled over the country. In a remarkably short time\n",
      "they appeared in millions of kitchens from coast-to-coast. Sales\n",
      "climbed to hundreds of thousands per day. Piltdon Opener went into\n",
      "peak production in three shifts, but was still unable to keep up with\n",
      "the demand. Construction was begun on a new plant, and additional\n",
      "plants were planned. Long lines waited in front of houseware stores.\n",
      "Department stores, lucky enough to have Super-Openers on hand, limited\n",
      "sales to one to a customer. Piltdon cancelled his advertising program.\n",
      "Newspapers, magazines, radio, television and word-of-mouth spread the\n",
      "fame of the opener so that advertising was unnecessary.\n",
      "\n",
      "Meanwhile, of course, government scientists, research foundations,\n",
      "universities and independent investigators began to look into this new\n",
      "phenomonen. Receiving no satisfactory explanation from Piltdon, they\n",
      "set up their own research.\n",
      "\n",
      "Far into the night burned the lights of countless laboratories. Noted\n",
      "physicists probed, measured, weighed, traced, X-rayed, dissolved,\n",
      "spun, peered at, photographed, magnetized, exploded, shattered and\n",
      "analyzed Super-Openers without achieving the glimmer of a satisfactory\n",
      "explanation. Competitors found the patent impossible to circumvent, for\n",
      "any departure from its exact specifications nullified the effect.\n",
      "\n",
      "Piltdon, genial these days with success and acclaim, roared at Feetch:\n",
      "\"I'm putting you in for a raise. Yes sir! To reward you for assisting\n",
      "me with my invention I'm raising your pay two hundred dollars a year.\n",
      "That's almost four dollars a week, man.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Thank you, Mr. Piltdon.\" And still, thought Feetch wryly, he received\n",
      "no recognition. His name did not even appear on the patent. Well,\n",
      "well, that was the way it went. He must find his satisfaction in his\n",
      "work. And it had been interesting lately, the work he had been doing\n",
      "nights at home investigating what had been named the Piltdon Effect.\n",
      "It had been difficult, working alone and buying his own equipment. The\n",
      "oscillator and ultra microwave tracking unit had been particularly\n",
      "expensive. He was a fool, he supposed, to try independent research when\n",
      "so many huge scientific organizations were working on it. But he could\n",
      "no more keep away from it than he could stop eating.\n",
      "\n",
      "He still didn't know where the cans went, but somehow he felt that he\n",
      "was close to the answer.\n",
      "\n",
      "When he finally found the answer, it was too late. The Borenchuck\n",
      "incident was only hours away.\n",
      "\n",
      "As soon as he could get hold of Piltdon, Feetch said trembling, \"Sir, I\n",
      "think I know where those cans are going. I recommend--\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Are you still worrying about that?\" Piltdon roared jovially. \"Leave\n",
      "that to the long-hairs. We're making money, that's all that counts, eh\n",
      "Feetch?\"\n",
      "\n",
      "*       *       *       *       *\n",
      "\n",
      "That night, at six-ten p.m., the Borenchuck family of Selby, South\n",
      "Dakota, sat down to their evening meal. Just as they started in on the\n",
      "soup, a rain of empty tin cans clattered down, splashed into the soup,\n",
      "raised a welt on the forehead of Borenchuck senior, settled down to a\n",
      "gentle, steady klunk! klunk! klunk! and inexorably began to pile up on\n",
      "the dining-room floor. They seemed to materialize from a plane just\n",
      "below the ceiling. The police called the fire department and the fire\n",
      "department stared helplessly and recommended the sanitation department.\n",
      "\n",
      "The incident made headlines in the local papers.\n",
      "\n",
      "The next day other local papers in widely scattered locations reported\n",
      "similar incidents.\n",
      "\n",
      "The following day, cans began falling on Chicago. St. Louis was next,\n",
      "and then over the entire nation the cans began to rain down. They fell\n",
      "outdoors and indoors, usually materializing at heights that were not\n",
      "dangerous. The deluge followed no pattern. Sometimes it would slacken,\n",
      "sometimes it would stop, sometimes begin heavily again. It fell in\n",
      "homes, on the streets, in theatres, trains, ships, universities and\n",
      "dog-food factories. No place was immune.\n",
      "\n",
      "People took to wearing hats indoors and out, and the sale of helmets\n",
      "boomed.\n",
      "\n",
      "All activity was seriously curtailed.\n",
      "\n",
      "A state of national emergency was declared.\n",
      "\n",
      "Government investigators went to work and soon confirmed what was\n",
      "generally suspected: these were the same cans that had been opened by\n",
      "the Piltdon Super-Opener.\n",
      "\n",
      "Statisticians and mathematicians calculated the mean rate of can\n",
      "precipitation and estimated that if all the cans opened by Piltdon\n",
      "openers were to come back, the deluge should be over in fifteen point\n",
      "twenty-nine days.\n",
      "\n",
      "Super-Opener sales of course immediately plummeted to zero and stayed\n",
      "there. Anti-Piltdon editorials appeared in the papers. Commentators\n",
      "accused Piltdon of deliberately hoaxing the public for his own gain. A\n",
      "Congressional investigation was demanded. Piltdon received threats of\n",
      "bodily injury. Lawsuits were filed against him. He barricaded himself\n",
      "in the plant, surrounded by bodyguards.\n",
      "\n",
      "Livid with fury and apprehension, he screamed at Feetch, \"This is your\n",
      "doing, you vandal! I'm a ruined man!\" A falling can caught him neatly\n",
      "on the tip of his nose.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"But sir,\" trembled Feetch, dodging three spaghetti cans, \"I tried to\n",
      "warn you.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"You're through, Feetch!\" raved Piltdon. \"Fired! Get out! But before\n",
      "you go, I want you to know that I've directed the blame where it\n",
      "belongs. I've just released to the press the truth about who created\n",
      "the Super-Opener. Now, get out!\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Yes, sir,\" said Feetch paling. \"Then you don't want to hear about my\n",
      "discovery of a way to prevent the cans from coming back?\"\n",
      "\n",
      "Klunk! A barrage of cans hit the floor, and both men took refuge under\n",
      "Piltdon's huge desk. \"No!\" yelled Piltdon at Feetch's face which was\n",
      "inches away. \"No, I----What did you say?\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"A small design improvement sir, and the cans would disappear forever.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "Klunk!\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Forever, Feetch?\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Yes sir.\" Klunk! Klunk!\n",
      "\n",
      "\"You're positive, Feetch?\" Piltdon's eyes glared into Feetch's.\n",

      "\"That's true,\" said Piltdon. His eyes grew dreamy. \"It can be done,\"\n",
      "he mused. \"The New Type Super-Opener. Free exchanges for the old.\n",
      "Cash guarantee that empty cans will never bother you. Take a licking\n",
      "at first, but then monopolize the market. All right, Feetch, I'll\n",
      "give you another chance. You'll turn over all the details to me. The\n",
      "patent on the improvement will naturally be mine. I'll get the credit\n",
      "for rectifying your blunder. Fine, fine. We'll work it out. Hop on\n",
      "production, at once, Feetch.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "Feetch felt himself sag inwardly. \"Mr. Piltdon,\" he said. \"I'm asking\n",
      "only one favor. Let me work full time on research and development,\n",
      "especially on the Piltdon effect. Hire a couple of extra men to help\n",
      "with production. I assure you the company will benefit in the end.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Damn it, no!\" roared Piltdon. \"How many times must I tell you? You got\n",
      "your job back, didn't you?\"\n",
      "\n",
      "The prospect of long years of heavy production schedules, restricted\n",
      "engineering and tight supervision suddenly made Kalvin Feetch feel\n",
      "very tired. Research, he thought. Development. What he had always\n",
      "wanted. Over the years he had waited, thinking that there would be\n",
      "opportunities later. But now he was growing older, and he felt that\n",
      "there might not be a later. Somehow he would manage to get along.\n",
      "Perhaps someone would give him a job working in the new field he had\n",
      "pioneered. With a sense of relief he realized that he had made his\n",
      "decision.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Mr. Piltdon,\" Feetch said. \"I--\" klunk!--\"resign.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "Piltdon started, extreme astonishment crossing his face.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"No use,\" said Feetch. \"Nothing you can say--\" klunk! klunk!\n",

      "\n",
      "\"But see here, the New Type Super-Opener...!\"\n",

      "\"Feetch!\" howled Piltdon. \"I order you to remain!\"\n",

      "Feetch almost submitted from force of habit. He hesitated for a moment,\n",
      "then turned abruptly.\n",
      "\n",

      "\n",
      "Money, Feetch decided after a while, was a good thing to have. His\n",
      "supply was running pretty low. He was not having any luck finding\n",
      "another job. Although the cans had stopped falling on the fifteenth\n",
      "day, as predicted by the statisticians, industry would not soon forget\n",
      "the inconvenience and losses caused by the deluge. It was not anxious\n",
      "to hire the man it regarded as responsible for the whole thing.\n",
      "\"Feetch,\" the personnel man would read. \"Kalvin Feetch.\" Then, looking\n",
      "up, \"Not the Kalvin Feetch who--\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Yes,\" Feetch would admit miserably.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"I am sorry, but--\"\n",
      "\n",
      "He did no better with research organizations. Typical was a letter\n",
      "from the Van Terrel Foundation: \"--cannot accept your application\n",
      "inasmuch as we feel your premature application of your discovery to\n",
      "profit-making denotes a lack of scientific responsibility and ethics\n",
      "not desirable in a member of our organization--former employer states\n",
      "the decision was yours entirely. Unfavorable reference--\"\n",
      "\n",
      "Piltdon, Feetch thought, feeling a strange sensation deep within his\n",
      "chest that he had not the experience to recognize as the beginning of a\n",
      "slow anger, Piltdon was hitting low and getting away with it.\n",
      "\n",
      "Of course, if he were to agree to reveal his latest discoveries to a\n",
      "research organization, he would undoubtedly get an appointment. But how\n",
      "could he? Everything patentable in his work would automatically revert\n",
      "to Piltdon under the one year clause in the company patent agreement.\n",
      "No, Feetch told himself, he was revealing nothing that Piltdon might\n",
      "grab. The anger began to mount.\n",
      "\n",
      "But he was beginning to need money desperately. Jenny wasn't getting\n",
      "any better and medical bills were running high.\n",
      "\n",
      "The phone rang. Feetch seized it and said to the image: \"Absolutely\n",
      "not.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"I'll go up another ten dollars,\" grated the little Piltdon image.\n",
      "\"Do you realize, man, this is the fourteenth raise I've offered you?\n",
      "A total increase of one hundred and twenty-six dollars? Be sensible,\n",
      "Feetch. I know you can't find work anywhere else.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Thanks to you. Mr. Piltdon, I wouldn't work for you if--\"\n",
      "\n",
      "A barrage of rocks crashed against the heavy steel screening of the\n",
      "window. \"What's going on!\" yelled Piltdon. \"Oh, I see. People throwing\n",
      "rocks at your house again? Oh, I know all about that, Feetch. I know\n",
      "that you're probably the most unpopular man alive to-day. I know about\n",
      "the rocks, the tomatoes, the rotten eggs, the sneaking out at night,\n",
      "the disguises you've had to use. Why don't you come back to us and\n",
      "change all that, Feetch? We'll put out the New Type Super-Opener and\n",
      "the world will soon forget about the old one.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"No,\" said Feetch. \"People will forget anyway--I hope.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"If you won't think of yourself, at least think of your fellow\n",
      "workmen,\" begged Piltdon, his voice going blurry. \"Do you realize that\n",
      "Piltdon Opener will soon be forced to close down, throwing all your\n",
      "former associates out of work? Think of Hanson, Sanchez, Forbes. They\n",
      "have families too. Think of the men in the shop, the girls in the\n",
      "office, the salesmen on the road. All, all unemployed because of you.\n",
      "Think of that, Feetch.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "Feetch blinked. This had not occurred to him.\n",
      "\n",
      "Piltdon eyed him sharply, then smiled with a hint of triumph. \"Think it\n",
      "over, Feetch.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "Feetch sat, thinking it over. Was it right to let all these people lose\n",
      "their jobs? Frowning, he dialed Hanson's number.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Chief,\" said Hanson, \"Forget it. The boys are behind you one hundred\n",
      "per cent. We'll make out.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"But that's the trouble. I thought you'd feel like this, and I can't\n",
      "let you.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"You're beginning to weaken. Don't. Think, chief, think. The brain that\n",
      "figured the Super-Opener can solve this.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "Feetch hung up. A glow of anger that had been building up in his chest\n",
      "grew warmer. He began pacing the floor. How he hated to do it. Think,\n",
      "Hanson had said. But he had. He's considered every angle, and there was\n",
      "no solution.\n",
      "\n",
      "Feetch walked into the kitchen and carefully poured himself a drink of\n",
      "water. He drank the water slowly and placed the glass on the washstand\n",
      "with a tiny click. It was the tiny click that did it. Something about\n",
      "it touched off the growing rage. If Piltdon were there he would have\n",
      "punched him in the nose. The twenty-five years. The tricks. The threats.\n",
      "\n",
      "Think? He'd figured the solution long ago, only he hadn't allowed\n",
      "himself to see it. Not lack of brains, lack of guts. Well, he thought\n",
      "grimly, dialing Piltdon's number, he was going through with it now.\n",
      "\"Piltdon!\" he barked. \"Three p.m. tomorrow. My place. Be here. That's\n",
      "all.\" He hung up.\n",
      "\n",
      "In the same grim mood the following morning, he placed a few more calls.\n",
      "\n",
      "*       *       *       *       *\n",
      "\n",
      "In the same mood that afternoon he stood in the middle of his\n",
      "living-room and looked at his visitors: Piltdon, Williams, the\n",
      "Government man; Billings from the Van Terrel Foundation; Steiner of\n",
      "Westchester University; the members of the press.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Gentlemen,\" he said. \"I'll make it brief.\" He waved the papers in his\n",
      "hand. \"Here is everything I know about what I call the Feetch Effect,\n",
      "including plans and specifications for the New Type Super-Opener.\n",
      "All of you have special reasons for being keenly interested in this\n",
      "information. I am now going to give a copy to each of you, providing\n",
      "one condition is met by Mr. Piltdon.\" He stared at Piltdon. \"In short,\n",
      "I want fifty-one per cent of the stock of Piltdon Opener.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "Piltdon leaped from his chair. \"Outrageous!\" He roared. \"Ridiculous!\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Fifty-one percent,\" said Feetch firmly. \"Don't bother with any\n",
      "counterproposals or the interview is at an end.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Gentlemen!\" squawked Piltdon, \"I appeal to you--\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Stop bluffing,\" said Feetch coldly. \"There's no other way out for\n",
      "you. Otherwise you're ruined. Here, sign this agreement.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "Piltdon threw the paper to the floor and screamed: \"Gentlemen, will you\n",
      "be a party to this?\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Well,\" murmured the Government man, \"I never did think Feetch got a\n",
      "fair shake.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"This information is important to science,\" said the Van Terrel man.\n",
      "\n",

      "\n",
      "Published in the newspapers the following day, Feetch's statement read,\n",
      "in part: \"The motion in space and time of the singular curvilinear\n",
      "proportions of the original Super-Opener combined with the capacitor\n",
      "effect built up as it increased its frictional electro-static charge\n",
      "in inverse proportion to the cube root of the tolerance between the\n",
      "involute teeth caused an instantaneous disruption of what I call the\n",
      "Alpha multi-dimensional screen. The can, being metallic, dropped\n",

      "instantly repaired by the stable nature of the screen.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Beyond the screen is what I call Alpha space, a space apparently quite\n",

      "indicated, Alpha space seems to be thickly inhabited. These\n",
      "inhabitants, the nature of whom I have not yet ascertained, obviously\n",
      "resented the intrusion of the cans, developed a method of disrupting\n",

      "\n",
      "\"However, I have established the existence of other spaces up to Mu\n",
